Data set obtained through simulation in PSIM using the Thermal Module. In the simulation, a three-phase half-bridge inverter is responsible for conditioning the DC power generated by the photovoltaic modules to supply an RL load. The mission profile used is composed of annual temperature and irradiance data from the city of Teresina in 2018. The semiconductor switches used in the simulation are the CM100TU-12H (Si) from Powerex and the C3M0015065D (SiC) from Wolfspeed.

The database contains 35,040 samples of six attributes: irradiance, environmental temperature, switching frequency, type of switch used (IGBT or MOSFET), junction temperature and junction temperature variation. In this study, we used the first four as inputs to train models that predicted the last two.
